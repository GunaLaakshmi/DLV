# DLV
In order to run the demo, you will first need to download the pre-trained data from this location. At 125 MB it's too large to put into the GitHub. Place the file in the model folder.

üìå Step-by-Step Process
1Ô∏è‚É£ Load the Pretrained Model
The code loads a pretrained deep learning model for colorization (colorization_release_v2.caffemodel). It also loads associated configuration files (colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt and pts_in_hull.npy).

python
Copy
Edit
prototxt = "/content/colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt"
model = "/content/colorization_release_v2.caffemodel"
points = "/content/pts_in_hull.npy"

net = cv2.dnn.readNetFromCaffe(prototxt, model)
pts_in_hull = np.load(points)
üí° Why?
This model is trained to add color to grayscale images using deep learning.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocess the Image
The input grayscale image is converted to the LAB color space.
The L (Lightness) channel is extracted and resized for the model.
Normalization is applied for proper brightness control.
python
Copy
Edit
image = cv2.imread(image_path)
image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)  # Convert from OpenCV format to normal RGB
lab = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_RGB2LAB)  # Convert to LAB color space

# Extract L channel
L = lab[:, :, 0]
L_resized = cv2.resize(L, (224, 224))
L_resized = L_resized.astype("float32") / 255.0 * 100 - 60  # Adjust brightness
üí° Why?

The L channel carries brightness information.
The model needs the L channel as input to predict missing colors.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Color Information (AB Channels)
The model predicts a and b channels (color components).
These predictions are resized to match the original image.
python
Copy
Edit
net.setInput(cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(L_resized))
ab = net.forward()[0, :, :, :].transpose((1, 2, 0))  # Get AB channels

# Resize to match original image dimensions
ab = cv2.resize(ab, (image.shape[1], image.shape[0]))
üí° Why?

The model learns patterns from trained colorized images to generate missing color details.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Merge Channels and Convert to RGB
The generated AB channels are combined with the original L channel.
The final LAB image is converted back to RGB format.
python
Copy
Edit
colorized_lab = np.concatenate((L[:, :, np.newaxis], ab), axis=2)
colorized = cv2.cvtColor(colorized_lab.astype("float32"), cv2.COLOR_LAB2RGB)
colorized = np.clip(colorized * 255, 0, 255).astype("uint8")  # Normalize values
üí° Why?

LAB format is better suited for realistic color enhancement.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Display & Save the Colorized Image
The original grayscale image and colorized image are displayed side by side.
The final image is saved and downloaded.
python
Copy
Edit
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 5))
ax[0].imshow(cv2.cvtColor(original, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
ax[0].set_title("Original Black & White")
ax[0].axis("off")
ax[1].imshow(colorized_img)
ax[1].set_title("Colorized Image")
ax[1].axis("off")
plt.show()

# Save and download the final image
cv2.imwrite("colorized_output.jpg", cv2.cvtColor(colorized_img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR))
files.download("colorized_output.jpg")
üéØ Expected Output
A black & white image on the left
A colorized image on the right ‚úÖ
